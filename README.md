## Warehouse Database

**Adele&co** Warehouse is a small but growing business that supplies natural ingredients like ðŸ¥¥oils, ðŸ§ˆbutters and powdersðŸ§´ to skincare brands and independent makers. 
For a long time, theyâ€™ve been tracking everything manually using spreadsheets and pen and paper to manage their inventory, supplier contacts and orders.

This old school system was starting to cause problems. 
- Products would constantly go out of stock without anyone noticing in time
- No easy way to analyse which products sold best or identify trends for better decision making
- Supplier contact details were scattered across spreadsheets, emails, and paper files, making communication slow.
- Some of their regular customers started looking elsewhere because Adele&co couldnâ€™t keep up with demand.

To fix this, the team decided to set up a proper database to make things easier. 
- The goal was to create something that would help them stay on top of inventory levels
- Flag low stock before it runs out
- Make supplier and order details easier to access and update. 

*Itâ€™s their first big step toward ditching the manual mess and getting a better handle on the business so they can grow without losing controlðŸš€*
