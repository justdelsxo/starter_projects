# CFG-Assignments
Hi, I’m **Adele Young** a passionate and curious learner currently diving into the world of **software engineering** through the CFGdegree! 🎓

### What ill be using Git hub for..
- 📁 Organising and storing my code and projects
- 🔄 Tracking changes with version control
- 🤝 Collaborating with instructors and peers through branches and pull requests

I’m *really* looking forward to becoming more confident with Git, GitHub & Python.
